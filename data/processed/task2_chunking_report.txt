TASK 2: CHUNKING STRATEGY REPORT
================================================================================

1. CHUNKING METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Library: LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   Chunk Size: 500 characters
   Chunk Overlap: 50 characters

   Rationale for chunk size (500 characters):
   - Balances context preservation with embedding quality
   - Large enough to capture meaningful context and complete thoughts
   - Small enough to ensure embeddings capture focused semantic meaning
   - Aligns with the pre-built embeddings specification (500 chars)

   Rationale for chunk overlap (50 characters):
   - Prevents loss of context at chunk boundaries
   - Ensures important information spanning chunk boundaries is preserved
   - 10% overlap provides good balance between redundancy and coverage

2. CHUNKING STATISTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Total chunks created: 37,158
   Average chunk length: 371 characters
   Median chunk length: 407 characters
   Min chunk length: 6 characters
   Max chunk length: 500 characters

   Average chunks per complaint: 3.10

3. SPLITTING STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter uses the following separators in order:
   1. Double newlines (\n\n) - Split on paragraph boundaries
   2. Single newlines (\n) - Split on line boundaries
   3. Periods followed by spaces (. ) - Split on sentence boundaries
   4. Spaces - Split on word boundaries
   5. Empty string - Split on character boundaries (last resort)

   This hierarchical approach preserves semantic structure when possible.
