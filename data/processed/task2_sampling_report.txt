TASK 2: SAMPLING STRATEGY REPORT
================================================================================

1. SAMPLING METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Method: Stratified Random Sampling
   Target Sample Size: 12,000
   Actual Sample Size: 11,995

   Rationale:
   - Stratified sampling ensures proportional representation across all
     product categories, maintaining the distribution of the full dataset
   - This approach prevents over-representation of dominant product categories
   - Each product category is sampled proportionally to its occurrence in
     the full dataset

2. SAMPLE DISTRIBUTION BY PRODUCT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Checking or savings account: 3,690 (30.76%)
   Credit card or prepaid card: 2,858 (23.83%)
   Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service: 2,556 (21.31%)
   Credit card: 2,121 (17.68%)
   Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan: 453 (3.78%)
   Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan: 233 (1.94%)
   Payday loan: 45 (0.38%)
   Money transfers: 39 (0.33%)

3. SAMPLING PARAMETERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Random Seed: 42 (for reproducibility)
   Minimum samples per category: 1
   Sampling method: Random sampling within each stratum
